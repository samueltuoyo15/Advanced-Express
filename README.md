# Express Concepts

A simple yet illustrative Express.js project showcasing essential concepts like middleware, CORS configuration, and basic server setup. This project serves as a foundational template for building more complex Node.js applications.

## Description

This project provides a basic Express.js server setup, complete with CORS configuration and custom middleware for request logging. It's designed to be a starting point for developers looking to understand and implement these core concepts in their own projects.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd express-concepts
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the server, and you can access it at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

The server is configured to run on port 5000. It includes the following features:

*   **CORS Configuration**: Implemented using the `cors` middleware to allow requests from specified origins (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
*   **Request Logging**: Custom middleware logs incoming requests to the console, providing valuable debugging information.
*   **Basic Express Setup**: Demonstrates how to set up a basic Express.js server and listen for incoming requests.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CORS Configuration | Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from specific origins.                                                                                  |
| Request Logging   | Implements custom middleware to log incoming requests, including timestamps, HTTP methods, URLs, and user agents.                                                           |
| Middleware        | Demonstrates the use of middleware functions to handle requests and responses. Includes `express.json()` for parsing JSON bodies and a custom middleware for adding timestamps.|
| Express Setup     | Sets up a basic Express.js server and listens for incoming requests on port 5000.                                                                                         |

| Node.js      | JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code.                                  |
| Express.js   | Web application framework for Node.js.                                                        |
| TypeScript   | Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.                                                 |
| Cors         | Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS. |
| Nodemon      | Utility that automatically restarts the server when file changes in the directory are detected. |
